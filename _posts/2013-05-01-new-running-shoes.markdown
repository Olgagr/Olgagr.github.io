After almost two years and running over 1500 km I’ve decided to buy a new running shoes. In fact, my husband promised me a new shoes after running my first half-marathon in March. Eventually we went shopping yesterday. I’m lucky because I have shop for runners just around the corner :) Until now I’ve run in Nike shoes – Nike Eclipse. There were great, they’ve never let me down. But, you know, it’s time to something new. I decided to buy more natural shoes, without too much stabilisations systems and other stuff with scary names. I choose Brooks Pure Cadence 2 and I fell in love with them after my yesterday training. They’re light, my feet feel really comfortable, no grazes, no squeezes. Of course, it wasn’t long run, just 7 kilometers (my usual distance on Tuesday) but I’m sure that on Sunday (18 kilometers to run) my shoes won’t fail as well :)
